### Choosing a dataset
Utilising the UK Road Safety: Traffic Accidents and Vehicles
Detailed dataset of road accidents and involved vehicles in the UK (2005-2017) we set out by forming 4 hypotheses so we could target the data relevant to our hypotheses and attempt to turn that raw data in to **meaningful information**.

### Hypothesis 1: Younger drivers are involved in more accidents
### Hypothesis 2: Driving on a weekday has no affect on the number of accidents.
### Hypothesis 3: Higher speed limit increases the number of accidents
### Hypothesis 4: There are more accidents when the weather conditions are bad

For each hypotheses we created a number of visulisations to display the data in an easier to analyse format which helped us understand the information required.
