# Which factors contribute to accident risk?

### Choosing a dataset
We used the UK Road Safety: Traffic Accidents and Vehicles
Detailed dataset of road accidents and involved vehicles in the UK (2005-2017).
Availble from Kaggle.com

There are 2 CSV files in this data set. Both CSV files were merged into a single dataframe. The resulting data file extremely large so a decision was made to focus on Years 2010-2016. This data was filtered and placed into a New CSV which is the main data used for all the investigation, analysis and plots.

We decided our client question would be **"which factors contribute to accident risk?"** and used this question to formulate 4 hypotheses and used these to target the data relevant to our hypotheses and attempt to turn that raw data in to **meaningful information**.

### Hypothesis 1: Younger drivers are involved in more accidents
### Hypothesis 2: Driving on a weekday has no affect on the number of accidents.
### Hypothesis 3: Higher speed limit increases the number of accidents
### Hypothesis 4: There are more accidents when the weather conditions are bad

For each hypotheses we created a number of visulisations to display the data in an easier to analyse format which helped us understand the information required.
